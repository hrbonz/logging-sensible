logging-sensible - A sensible set of defaults and presets for sensible logging
##############################################################################

This module came out of my frustration with the logging module in python. While
extremely powerful, it's also forcing you to write a lot of boilerplate code to
do very simple things.

The aims here are to provide:
* sensible defaults for your logging
* helpers for the most common usage patterns
* minimum dependencies on external libraries
